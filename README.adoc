This is a plugin for Neovim that provides additional functionality for link:https://github.com/orhun/daktilo[daktilo].

== Features
- Reports the current column number to daktilo while in insert mode. This can be used to play sounds depending on the column number *ding*.

=== Planned
- Report active / inactive to switch between editor / char based mode in daktilo (not supported by daktilo yet).
- Report current workspace to daktilo (not supported by daktilo yet).

=== Known issues
- Daktilo needs to be started before Neovim. Otherwise the plugin will not work.
- Occasionally crashes nvim :confounded:.

== Installation
Currently you need to download the plugin binary and import it using lua require. This will be changed in the future.

```lua
require('daktilo-nvim').start()
```

== Configuration
The plugin can be configured by passing a table to the start function.

```lua
require('daktilo-nvim').start({
  -- The port to use for the gRPC server in daktilo.
  rpc_port = 50051,
})
```

== Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss the changes you would like to make.
